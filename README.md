# Gold Miner

## Introduction

This project is a two players online gold miner game written in Java. I wrote it to hand it in as homework...

## How to play

```
# Player Zero
java -jar GoldMiner.jar <Port Number> <FPS>
# Player One
java -jar GoldMiner.jar <IP Address> <Port Number> <FPS>
```
For example, if you want to play it from localhost:
```
# Player Zero
java -jar GoldMiner.jar 9999 60
# Player One
java -jar GoldMiner.jar 127.0.0.1 9999 60
```
Press `DOWN` key to move, press `SPACE` key to pause or resume the game.
